# Web-Scraping-FinBERT-Sentiment-Analysis
Web Scraping from BSE Website + FinBERT sentiment analysis + Trading algorithm using Backtrader

This repository contains the code that I implemented for an academic project in the area of algorithmic trading. The IPython notebook contains the code for web scraping corporate communications from the BSE website using Selenium, analysing the documents using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model and implementing a trading strategy with Backtrader.
